# Robust-Criminal-Identification-System-for-Recognition-of-Obscure-and-Hidden-Faces
This is a project designed to enhance the capabilities of facial recognition systems, particularly in scenarios where faces are obscured or hidden. The goal is to develop a system that can identify individuals even when their faces are not fully visible, which can be crucial in law enforcement and security applications.
The System has Ability to 
1] The system excels in accurately detecting multiple faces, even when individuals are wearing glasses or masks. 
2] This breakthrough significantly enhances the system's practicality and effectiveness in real-world scenarios, surpassing traditional limitations.
3] Beyond facial recognition, our system collects data on specific facial regions while taking 100 images of entire face & especially on eyes and 50 images for nose & mouth,, offering a nuanced approach to criminal identification.
